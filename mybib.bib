	abstract = {Transfer learning aims to reduce the amount of data required to excel at a new task by re-using the knowledge acquired from learning other related tasks. This paper proposes a novel transfer learning scenario, which distills robust phonetic features from grounding models that are trained to tell whether a pair of image and speech are semantically correlated, without using any textual transcripts. As semantics of speech are largely determined by its lexical content, grounding models learn to preserve phonetic information while disregarding uncorrelated factors, such as speaker and channel. To study the properties of features distilled from different layers, we use them as input separately to train multiple speech recognition models. Empirical results demonstrate that layers closer to input retain more phonetic information, while following layers exhibit greater invariance to domain shift. Moreover, while most previous studies include training data for speech recognition for feature extractor training, our grounding models are not trained on any of those data, indicating more universal applicability to new domains.},

We investigate a lattice rescoring algorithm that integrates information from the image at two different points: the image is used to augment the language model with the most likely words, and to rescore the top hypotheses using a word-level RNN. This rescoring mechanism decreases the word error rate by 3 absolute percentage points, compared to a baseline speech recognizer operating with only the speech recording.},

	abstract = {The existing event classification (EC) work primarily focuseson the traditional supervised learning setting in which models are unableto extract event mentions of new/unseen event types. Few-shot learninghas not been investigated in this area although it enables EC models toextend their operation to unobserved event types. To fill in this gap, inthis work, we investigate event classification under the few-shot learningsetting. We propose a novel training method for this problem that exten-sively exploit the support set during the training process of a few-shotlearning model. In particular, in addition to matching the query exam-ple with those in the support set for training, we seek to further matchthe examples within the support set themselves. This method providesmore training signals for the models and can be applied to every metric-learning-based few-shot learning methods. Our extensive experiments ontwo benchmark EC datasets show that the proposed method can improvethe best reported few-shot learning models by up to 10\% on accuracyfor event classification},
